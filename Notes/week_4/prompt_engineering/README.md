# Prompt Engineering Notes

### **Introduction to Prompt Engineering**

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to guide the behavior of language models (such as GPT, BERT, and other large language models, LLMs) to produce desired outputs. It is a crucial skill for interacting with AI systems, particularly in the context of generative models, where the quality of the output heavily depends on the structure and wording of the input prompt.

---

### **Why is Prompt Engineering Important?**

LLMs, like GPT, generate text based on patterns learned from large datasets. However, they do not inherently understand the context, nuances, or goals behind a user's request. By designing a well-structured prompt, you can significantly improve the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the AI’s response.

Effective prompt engineering can:

- **Enhance output quality**: By guiding the model to focus on specific aspects or tone.
- **Improve accuracy**: By ensuring the model generates factually correct or contextually appropriate responses.
- **Reduce biases**: By framing prompts to minimize the risk of bias in the generated content.
- **Maximize efficiency**: By reducing the need for post-processing or corrections.

---

### **Core Concepts of Prompt Engineering**

### **1. Clarity and Specificity**

The more specific and clear the prompt, the more likely the model is to generate a relevant and accurate response. Ambiguous or vague prompts often lead to unsatisfactory or generalized outputs.

- **Example of a vague prompt**: "Tell me about history."
- **Example of a specific prompt**: "Can you provide a summary of the causes of World War I?"

### **2. Instruction-Based Prompts**

Giving explicit instructions or context within the prompt can help guide the AI to follow a desired path. This includes setting the tone, format, and type of response expected.

- **Example**: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms for beginners."
- **Example with tone**: "Write a formal letter explaining the company's new policy changes to employees."

### **3. Question-Driven Prompts**

Using a question-driven approach can help focus the model on providing direct answers. This is especially useful for fact-based or informational requests.

- **Example**: "What are the benefits of machine learning in healthcare?"

### **4. Role-Playing Prompts**

In role-playing prompts, you set the context for the AI by assigning it a role. This can guide the model to generate responses in a specific style, tone, or voice.

- **Example**: "You are an experienced software engineer. How would you approach debugging a complex issue in a production environment?"

### **5. Structured Prompts**

Providing structured input helps the model to generate organized, coherent responses. This can include lists, bullet points, or step-by-step instructions.

- **Example**: "List the steps for setting up a Docker container on Linux."

---

### **Types of Prompts**

1. **Direct Prompts**: Directly ask for information or an action.
    - **Example**: "Translate the following sentence into Spanish."
2. **Contextual Prompts**: Provide context to guide the model’s response.
    - **Example**: "Given that you are a professional copywriter, write a catchy headline for an e-commerce ad campaign."
3. **Task-Oriented Prompts**: Ask the model to perform a specific task or solve a problem.
    - **Example**: "Generate a Python script that converts a CSV file to JSON format."
4. **Creative Prompts**: Used for generating creative content like stories, poems, or brainstorming ideas.
    - **Example**: "Write a short story about a time traveler who accidentally changes history."
5. **Comparison or Evaluation Prompts**: Request a comparison or evaluation of options or ideas.
    - **Example**: "Compare the advantages and disadvantages of electric cars and gasoline cars."

### **Zero-shot Prompting and Few-shot Prompting**

Zero-shot and few-shot prompting are two approaches for interacting with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or GPT-4. These approaches refer to how much information (in terms of examples) is provided to the model within the prompt. Both techniques allow you to leverage the model’s ability to generalize across tasks without the need for extensive retraining.

---

### **Zero-shot Prompting**

**Zero-shot prompting** refers to asking the model to perform a task or answer a question **without providing any examples**. This is based entirely on the model’s pre-existing knowledge and ability to generalize from its training.

In zero-shot prompting, the model is expected to understand and perform tasks based on the instruction provided, even if it hasn't seen examples specifically demonstrating how to complete the task.

### **When to Use Zero-shot Prompting**

- **General tasks**: When you want the model to perform a task without specifying examples, such as answering a factual question, summarizing content, or translating text.
- **Testing the model's ability to generalize**: When you don’t have examples available or need to assess how well the model can handle new scenarios.
- **Short tasks or queries**: Tasks that are well-defined and don’t require extensive context or specific examples.

### **Example of Zero-shot Prompting**

- **Task**: Translate a sentence into French.
    - **Prompt**: "Translate 'How are you today?' into French."
    - **Expected Output**: "Comment ça va aujourd'hui ?"
- **Task**: Summarize a paragraph.
    - **Prompt**: "Summarize the following paragraph in one sentence: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"
    - **Expected Output**: "A quick fox jumps over a lazy dog."

In these examples, no additional context or examples are provided, and the model relies on its training to perform the task.

---

### **Few-shot Prompting**

**Few-shot prompting** involves providing **a few examples** of the task you want the model to perform within the prompt itself. These examples help guide the model in understanding the specific format or style you want, especially if the task is complex or requires a specific approach.

Few-shot prompting works by showing the model how to complete a task based on a limited number of instances. The model then generalizes the pattern or structure from these examples to apply to a new task.

### **When to Use Few-shot Prompting**

- **Complex tasks**: When the task involves a nuanced or complex format that may be difficult to understand from a single instruction.
- **Custom formats**: When you need the model to follow a specific style, structure, or tone (e.g., writing in a particular format or generating content with specific attributes).
- **Improving accuracy**: When you want to improve the likelihood of getting a specific type of output, such as classifying text into categories or performing calculations.

### **Example of Few-shot Prompting**

- **Task**: Translate sentences into French.
    - **Prompt**:
        - "Translate 'Hello' into French: 'Bonjour'."
        - "Translate 'Goodbye' into French: 'Au revoir'."
        - "Translate 'How are you today?' into French: "
    - **Expected Output**: "Comment ça va aujourd'hui ?"
- **Task**: Convert numbers to words.
    - **Prompt**:
        - "Convert '12' to words: 'twelve'."
        - "Convert '45' to words: 'forty-five'."
        - "Convert '103' to words: "
    - **Expected Output**: "one hundred and three."

In these examples, the model is given a few instances of how the task should be performed. By using these examples, the model is better able to infer the structure and apply the same reasoning to the new input.

---

### **Constraints**

When working with large language models (LLMs) like GPT, **constraints** refer to the limitations or conditions that guide the behavior and outputs of the model. Constraints can be used in both **prompt engineering** and in the way LLMs are used within specific applications. These constraints are typically set to ensure that the model’s behavior aligns with user expectations, reduces errors, or makes the response more relevant or appropriate.

### **Types of Constraints**

1. **Length Constraints**
    - **Character or Token Limit**: The length of the model's response is often restricted to a certain number of characters or tokens. This is particularly important when generating text that fits within a certain size, such as in summaries, titles, or descriptions.
        - **Example**: "Summarize the following paragraph in 50 words or less."
    - **Implications**: Exceeding the token limit can result in truncated outputs, while setting a limit too low may lead to incomplete answers.
2. **Format Constraints**
    - The desired format for the output is specified, which might include structured formats like lists, bullet points, or specific templates.
        - **Example**: "Write a product description in three bullet points: 1) Key features, 2) Benefits, 3) How to use."
    - **Implications**: Enforcing a strict format might limit creativity or lead to less fluid, human-like responses but can make output easier to process.
3. **Tone and Style Constraints**
    - This involves specifying the tone or style of the output, such as formal, casual, technical, persuasive, or empathetic.
        - **Example**: "Write a response to the customer complaint in a polite and formal tone."
    - **Implications**: The model may struggle with tone consistency, especially when the prompt is vague, leading to outputs that are either too stiff or too casual.
4. **Content Constraints**
    - These constraints ensure that certain topics, words, or ideas are either included or excluded in the response. It can also include restrictions on generating harmful or biased content.
        - **Example**: "Write a summary of World War II without mentioning any specific battles."
    - **Implications**: Content constraints can limit the creativity or depth of responses but are useful for aligning outputs with legal, ethical, or cultural standards.
5. **Factual Accuracy Constraints**
    - In cases where factual accuracy is critical (e.g., legal documents, medical advice), constraints can be placed to ensure the model adheres to specific facts or guidelines.
        - **Example**: "Provide the latest information about AI research in healthcare (ensure that all statements are verified)."
    - **Implications**: Models might generate incorrect information due to limitations in training data or inability to access real-time information.
6. **Behavioral Constraints**
    - Constraints on how the model should behave in terms of interactivity, responsiveness, or emotional tone.
        - **Example**: "Respond with empathy and provide actionable advice when someone says they are feeling anxious."
    - **Implications**: These constraints guide the model toward ethical or desirable behaviors but may not always be fully aligned with the model’s inherent abilities to understand and interact with emotions.
7. **Input Constraints**
    - Constraints can also be applied to the inputs fed into the model. For instance, limiting the input length, simplifying input data, or restricting the type of information provided.
        - **Example**: "Only respond to the following question: 'What is the capital of France?'"
    - **Implications**: Input constraints help in narrowing down the focus of the response, but overly restrictive inputs may limit the depth of the answer.
8. **Behavioral Ethics Constraints**
    - These constraints focus on ensuring that the outputs of the model do not generate harmful, biased, or discriminatory content.
        - **Example**: "Ensure the content does not perpetuate stereotypes or offensive language."
    - **Implications**: Though ethical constraints are necessary to ensure fairness, models might still inadvertently generate outputs that reflect biases in their training data.

---

### **Enforcing Constraints in Prompt Engineering**

When designing prompts to adhere to constraints, it's important to be explicit and clear. Here’s how to enforce some common constraints within your prompts:

1. **Clear Instruction**:
    - Always clearly state what the model should (or should not) do.
    - **Example**: "Write a 100-word summary of this article, focusing only on the environmental impacts."
2. **Token or Character Limits**:
    - Explicitly include constraints on length or size.
    - **Example**: "Write a response in no more than 150 characters."
3. **Use of Examples**:
    - Provide examples within the prompt to clarify the type of output required.
    - **Example**: "Translate these phrases into Spanish. Example: 'Hello' → 'Hola'. Now translate 'Goodbye'."
4. **Tone and Style**:
    - Specify the tone and style, especially for customer-facing or formal outputs.
    - **Example**: "Write a professional, respectful email to a customer explaining a service disruption."
5. **Guidelines for Ethical Responses**:
    - Ask the model to ensure neutrality and avoid harmful content.
    - **Example**: "Write a report on climate change, ensuring that all information is sourced from credible scientific studies and does not include any controversial opinions."

### **Fine-Tuning and Conditioning in LLMs**

**Fine-tuning** and **conditioning** are two essential concepts in adapting and controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Both methods enhance the model’s performance by tailoring it to better align with particular use cases or requirements. Here’s an overview of each concept:

---

### **1. Fine-Tuning**

**Fine-tuning** refers to the process of further training a pre-trained model on a specific, often smaller, dataset to make it more specialized for a particular task. This involves adjusting the weights of the model through additional training steps, using task-specific data that wasn't part of the model’s original training set.

### **How Fine-Tuning Works:**

- **Pre-trained Models**: The model is typically pre-trained on a large, diverse corpus of text (like Common Crawl or Wikipedia). This enables the model to learn general language patterns, structure, and knowledge.
- **Task-Specific Dataset**: Fine-tuning uses a smaller, specialized dataset related to the specific task (e.g., medical data for medical applications, legal documents for legal tasks, etc.). This helps the model specialize in particular vocabulary, styles, or knowledge.
- **Adjusting Model Weights**: The pre-trained model's weights are updated during fine-tuning to make it more suitable for the target task, but it retains the broader capabilities it learned during the pre-training phase.

### **When to Use Fine-Tuning:**

- **Custom Tasks**: When you have specific requirements (e.g., classification tasks, document summarization, chatbot conversations in a specific domain).
- **Specialized Knowledge**: When the model needs to be knowledgeable in a particular field (e.g., law, medicine, or finance).
- **Improving Performance**: Fine-tuning can improve performance on tasks the base model wasn’t trained for, like technical jargon or particular writing styles.

### **Example of Fine-Tuning**

- **Task**: A language model that generates medical advice.
    - You might fine-tune a general-purpose model on a medical corpus to improve its understanding of medical terminology, ethical guidelines, and appropriate responses.

### **Advantages of Fine-Tuning:**

- **Customization**: You can tailor a model to your specific domain, which improves task accuracy and relevance.
- **Improved Results**: Fine-tuning often leads to better performance for specialized tasks, as the model adapts to your data.

### **Challenges of Fine-Tuning:**

- **Computational Resources**: Fine-tuning large models can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.
- **Overfitting**: If the fine-tuning dataset is too small, the model might overfit to it, losing its generalization capabilities.

---

### **2. Conditioning**

**Conditioning** refers to providing specific context or instructions to guide the model’s behavior or output. Conditioning doesn't involve retraining the model but instead involves manipulating the input or prompt to direct the model’s response in a particular way. It's more about how you craft your prompts to influence the model’s generation, rather than changing its internal weights.

### **How Conditioning Works:**

- **Contextual Prompts**: You give the model specific context or instructions (i.e., "condition") so it understands the intended output format, style, tone, or focus. This can be done by altering the prompt or adding examples that show the model the correct way to respond.
- **Dynamic**: Conditioning is more flexible and often occurs in real-time with each request.

### **When to Use Conditioning:**

- **Real-time Adjustments**: When you need to quickly guide the model to generate different types of outputs without the need for training.
- **Customizing Output Style or Tone**: For tasks like summarizing, answering questions, or writing in different tones (e.g., formal, casual, empathetic).
- **Task Flexibility**: When a model needs to handle various types of inputs without needing to be retrained.

### **Example of Conditioning**

- **Task**: Generating a polite email.
    - **Prompt**: "Write an email to a customer explaining a delay in their order. Be polite and empathetic."
    - The model uses this instruction to generate a response that fits the style and tone specified in the prompt.

### **Advantages of Conditioning:**

- **Efficiency**: It doesn’t require retraining, so it’s much quicker to implement.
- **Flexibility**: You can adjust the output dynamically by changing the prompt or context, providing high versatility.
- **Control**: You can exert fine-grained control over specific output features (e.g., tone, length, detail level).

### **Challenges of Conditioning:**

- **Complexity in Prompting**: It can sometimes be tricky to craft the perfect prompt that yields the exact desired output.
- **Limited Customization**: Conditioning cannot change the model’s internal knowledge or capabilities, only how it responds based on the given prompt.

### **Fine-Tuning vs Conditioning**

| **Aspect** | **Fine-Tuning** | **Conditioning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approach** | Further training the model on a specialized dataset. | Modifying the input to guide model behavior. |
| **Task Scope** | Adapts the model for specific tasks or domains. | Adjusts output based on context or instructions. |
| **Time and Resources** | Time-consuming and resource-intensive. | Real-time, no additional training needed. |
| **Output Control** | Produces more accurate, domain-specific outputs. | Guides output to match the prompt's requirements. |
| **Customization Level** | High — allows deep adaptation to specific tasks. | Moderate — depends on the prompt structure. |
| **Generalization** | Model retains its ability to generalize while adapting to new tasks. | No change in generalization ability. |

### **Interaction and Dialog State**

In the context of conversational AI, **interaction state** and **dialog state** refer to the tracking and management of the ongoing conversation’s context, flow, and history. Managing this state effectively is crucial for creating coherent, meaningful, and context-aware interactions in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other dialog systems.

Here’s an in-depth look at **interaction** and **dialog state**, how they work, and why they are important in AI systems like large language models (LLMs):

---

### **1. Interaction State**

**Interaction state** refers to the current state of the ongoing conversation or interaction between the user and the system. It includes the information needed to understand the context of the conversation and track its progress. This is often updated continuously as the user provides new input.

### **Key Components of Interaction State**:

- **User Input**: The most recent message or command from the user.
- **Model Response**: The system's response to the user’s input.
- **User Intent**: The goal or purpose the user is trying to achieve in the interaction (e.g., asking for information, making a request, etc.).
- **Entities**: Specific pieces of information identified in the user’s input (e.g., names, dates, locations).
- **Contextual Data**: Any additional context, such as the user’s previous inputs or the current task being handled.

### **Importance of Interaction State**:

- **Continuity**: It ensures that the system doesn’t treat each message as a standalone prompt but understands how it fits into the ongoing conversation.
- **User Personalization**: Interaction state can be used to personalize responses based on prior inputs (e.g., remembering the user’s preferences or past actions).
- **Task Progress**: It helps in tracking the progress of a task, such as whether a user is completing a multi-step process (e.g., booking a flight, ordering food).

### **Examples**:

- A virtual assistant tracking the user’s location in a navigation app and providing directions based on real-time updates.
- A chatbot remembering the user’s name, preferences, or specific questions across multiple messages.

---

### **2. Dialog State**

**Dialog state** refers to the broader context of the entire conversation, including the history of interactions, the model’s understanding of the conversation's goal, and the progress toward that goal. It’s a persistent state that tracks the entire dialog session, and it helps ensure that the system’s responses are relevant to both the current input and the past interactions.

### **Key Components of Dialog State**:

- **Conversation History**: A record of previous user inputs and model responses. This includes messages that may be relevant to the ongoing conversation but may no longer be part of the current interaction.
- **Dialogue History**: This includes both explicit (what the user said) and implicit (the model’s interpretation, such as inferred goals or past behavior).
- **Task or Intent Tracking**: The model’s understanding of the user’s overall intent or goal. For example, if the user is asking questions about flight booking, the dialog state keeps track of this goal.
- **Contextual Memory**: Any knowledge about the user or situation that can help improve responses. This can include user preferences, location, time of day, or previous actions taken in the conversation.

### **Importance of Dialog State**:

- **Coherent Conversations**: By keeping track of the entire conversation’s flow, dialog state enables the model to provide coherent responses that align with the overall context and user intent.
- **Avoiding Repetition**: The model can avoid asking the user for the same information multiple times by remembering previous exchanges.
- **Goal-Oriented Interactions**: It helps guide interactions toward a clear goal. For example, in a customer service dialog, the state keeps track of whether an issue has been resolved or if further actions are needed.

### **Examples**:

- A customer service chatbot remembering the nature of the user’s problem (e.g., a refund request) and the actions taken in previous steps, such as offering a solution or escalating the issue.
- An AI assistant remembering the context of a user’s previous request (e.g., setting a reminder, checking weather conditions) and offering more relevant suggestions based on the previous dialog.

---

### **Managing Interaction and Dialog State**

Managing interaction and dialog state effectively in LLM-based systems is challenging because the model itself does not inherently have memory beyond a single input-output cycle. However, there are several ways to maintain and track dialog state:

### **1. Explicit State Management**:

- **State Variables**: Maintaining explicit variables for dialog state, such as a dictionary or object, that stores key details from the conversation. This can include things like the user’s name, preferences, and previous actions.
- **State Transitions**: Defining rules or logic that govern how the state should evolve. For example, after a user chooses a product, the dialog state would shift to reflect the choice and ask for payment details.

### **2. Contextual Embeddings**:

- In some advanced models, context is maintained through **contextual embeddings**. This involves passing the entire conversation history (or a relevant subset) to the model at each turn to help it maintain the conversation’s flow.
- **Example**: In a long conversation, the model might use a sliding window of the last N messages to keep track of the context.

### **3. External Memory or Database**:

- Storing dialog state externally (e.g., in a database or session storage) allows the model to maintain long-term state across multiple interactions. This method is especially useful for applications that need to persist user preferences, past interactions, or ongoing tasks.
- **Example**: A shopping assistant remembers the user’s previous items in the cart between sessions or during multi-turn conversations.

### **4. Hybrid Approaches**:

- Some systems combine fine-tuned models with rule-based systems or external memory to manage dialog state. For instance, a rule-based component can track the steps of a task, while the language model generates natural language responses based on the user’s inputs and the stored context.

---

### **Best Practices for Handling Dialog State**

1. **Limit Context Size**: When using contextual embeddings, be mindful of the token limits in the model (e.g., GPT-3 has a token limit of around 4,096 tokens). Use techniques like truncating the context window or summarizing past exchanges to manage the conversation’s context effectively.
2. **Store Key Information**: Instead of storing everything, focus on storing only the most critical pieces of information (e.g., user preferences, current goals) to prevent the dialog state from becoming unwieldy.
3. **Personalization**: Make use of dialog state to personalize the interaction. For example, tracking past interactions allows the model to make recommendations or provide consistent responses in line with user preferences.
4. **Error Handling**: Track the state of the conversation in case of errors. If the model or system fails to follow the flow (e.g., asking the same question twice), a fallback mechanism should help the system recover and resume the conversation smoothly.
5. **User Confirmation**: Regularly confirm with the user that the state is being tracked correctly. For example, a user might say, "No, that's not what I meant," allowing the system to adjust the dialog state appropriately.

---

### **Instructions and Guidelines**

In AI systems, especially those that involve **large language models (LLMs)** like GPT, BERT, and others, **instructions** and **guidelines** play a crucial role in guiding both the model and the user towards desired behaviors, outcomes, and expectations. They help define how interactions should unfold, what goals to achieve, and how to handle various scenarios effectively. Below, we’ll explore the role of instructions and guidelines in AI, and how they are used to improve user experiences and system responses.

---

### **1. Instructions for AI Models**

**Instructions** are directives given to an AI model to specify how it should behave, respond, or process information. They can vary based on the task, the expected output, or the user's needs.

### **Types of Instructions:**

1. **Task-Oriented Instructions**: These specify what the model should do. For example:
    - “Generate a summary of this text.”
    - “Translate this sentence into French.”
    - “Provide a step-by-step explanation for solving this problem.”
2. **Style-Oriented Instructions**: These specify how the model should present the information. For example:
    - “Write in a formal tone.”
    - “Be concise and use bullet points.”
    - “Provide a detailed and technical explanation.”
3. **Input Format Instructions**: These define how the input should be processed or structured. For example:
    - “If the input is a question, provide an answer in two sentences.”
    - “For a date, respond with the full format: ‘Month day, year.’”
4. **Task Constraints**: These add limitations or conditions on how the task should be carried out. For example:
    - “Provide an answer only using information from the last 5 years.”
    - “Do not include any personal opinions.”

### **Best Practices for Providing Instructions**:

- **Be Clear and Specific**: The more specific the instructions, the more likely the model will follow them correctly. Avoid ambiguous or general commands.
- **Use Contextual Cues**: Provide context if necessary, such as previous messages or additional information that might influence the response.
- **Set Expectations**: If you want a specific format or length for the output, clearly state that in the instructions (e.g., “Write a 100-word summary”).

### **Example of Task-Oriented Instructions**:

- **Task**: Answering a technical question.
    - **Instruction**: “Explain how neural networks work. Use a simple analogy to make the concept easy to understand for beginners.”

### **Example of Style-Oriented Instructions**:

- **Task**: Writing a poem.
    - **Instruction**: “Write a poem in the style of a haiku with a theme of nature.”

---

### **2. Guidelines for AI Systems**

**Guidelines** are a broader set of principles or best practices that inform the design, deployment, and usage of AI models. They provide a framework for ensuring that the system operates ethically, effectively, and within acceptable boundaries.

### **Types of Guidelines**:

1. **Ethical Guidelines**:
    - Ensure that the AI behaves in a responsible and ethical manner.
    - Avoid generating harmful, biased, or discriminatory content.
    - Example: Ensuring the AI doesn’t promote hate speech, misinformation, or illegal activities.
2. **Safety and Security Guidelines**:
    - Prevent the model from generating harmful or unsafe responses.
    - Protect user privacy and avoid misuse of personal data.
    - Example: Avoid asking for sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or private identifiers.
3. **User Experience Guidelines**:
    - Aim for a seamless, intuitive, and positive interaction with the AI system.
    - Example: Maintain a polite tone, respond in a helpful and informative manner, and ensure the model’s answers are clear and actionable.
4. **Operational Guidelines**:
    - Ensure that the system performs effectively and reliably.
    - Example: Limit response time to ensure a prompt user experience, and ensure that the model doesn’t provide excessive or irrelevant information.
5. **Transparency Guidelines**:
    - Provide transparency about the model’s capabilities and limitations.
    - Example: Inform users if the model cannot answer a specific question or if it is drawing on limited data (e.g., “I don’t have information on that topic”).
6. **Bias Mitigation**:
    - Ensure that the model does not exhibit biased behavior or reinforce harmful stereotypes.
    - Example: Actively avoid generating content that reflects gender, racial, or cultural biases.

### **Best Practices for AI Guidelines**:

- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular evaluations to ensure the AI is following the ethical, operational, and safety guidelines.
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize user needs and feedback in shaping the AI’s guidelines.
- **Clear Communication**: Be transparent with users about the AI’s abilities and limitations to manage expectations.

---

### **3. Integrating Instructions and Guidelines**

In practice, **instructions** and **guidelines** are interdependent. Clear instructions help the AI perform specific tasks effectively, while broad guidelines ensure that the AI behaves ethically and responsibly in diverse scenarios.

### **Combining Instructions and Guidelines**:

- **Task Instructions**: For example, if an AI is used for customer support, instructions could specify: “If the customer asks about refund policies, explain clearly the steps for requesting a refund.” These task-specific instructions are fine-tuned to handle particular queries.
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Simultaneously, ethical guidelines should ensure that the AI responds politely, avoids giving financial advice without context, and doesn’t encourage harmful behavior like refund fraud.

### **Example of Using Both Together**:

- **Scenario**: A user asks for advice on creating a budget.
    - **Instruction**: “Provide general advice on how to manage personal finances without offering any investment or financial planning services.”
    - **Guideline**: “Ensure the advice is neutral and does not provide personalized financial advice that could lead to harm or mislead the user.”

---

### **4. Guidelines for Prompt Engineering**

When crafting instructions for a language model (prompt engineering), guidelines become vital in ensuring that the input is formulated in a way that leads to optimal output.

### **Prompt Engineering Guidelines**:

- **Provide Clear and Direct Requests**: Ambiguous prompts lead to unclear or irrelevant responses. For example, instead of asking, “What is machine learning?” ask, “Provide a brief explanation of machine learning with examples of its applications.”
- **Limit the Scope**: For more specific answers, narrow down the focus of the prompt. For example, instead of asking, “Tell me about the environment,” ask, “What are the main causes of climate change?”
- **Incorporate Examples**: If you want a particular style of response, include examples in the prompt. For instance, “Write a short story about a detective. Here’s an example of the style: [provide example].”
