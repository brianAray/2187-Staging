  - Array vs. ArrayList.
  - Removing duplicates from a List.
  - Collections API (List, Set, Queue).
- **Key Features:**
  - Wrapper classes, static keyword, final vs. finally.
  - Singleton pattern and garbage collection.
  - Functional programming (Lambdas, method references, Streams).
- **Advanced Topics:**
  - Reflection API.
  - Multithreading (Threads/Runnables).
- **Practical Coding:** 
  - Merge sorted arrays, find unique values, bubble sort.

---

### **SQL**
- **Sub-languages & Operations:** DDL, DML, DQL, TCL.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - ACID properties of transactions.
  - SQL Joins: Inner, Outer, Cross.
  - Normalization and normal forms.
  - Grouping and filtering results (`GROUP BY`, `WHERE`).
- **Practical:**
  - Creating tables, foreign keys, and views in PostgreSQL.
  - Writing queries to select, update, and delete.

---

### **HTTP and APIs**
- Basics of HTTP and status codes.
- RESTful APIs: Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Tools like Postman for testing APIs.

---

### **Spring Framework**
- **Core Concepts:**
  - Spring vs. Spring Boot.
  - Beans and their scopes.
  - Key annotations (`@Component`, `@Entity`, `@Transactional`).
  - REST API implementation with Spring MVC.
- **Data Layer:**
  - JPA and database interactions.
  - `RestTemplate` for HTTP communication.
- **Advanced:**
  - Error handling in Spring.
  - Dependency injection and autowiring.

---

### **React/Frontend**
- **Core Concepts:**
  - Components, props vs. state.
  - TSX vs. JSX.
  - Virtual DOM vs. Real DOM.
- **Advanced Topics:**
  - Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
  - Routing and conditional rendering.
- **Practical:**
  - Rendering lists, handling events, using Axios.

---

### **Cloud/SDLC**
- **Agile Methodology:** Processes and retrospectives.
- **AWS:** Hosting projects and services used.
- **Software Design Principles:** SOLID, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.

---

### **Git**
- Basic Git commands (push, pull, merge).
- Branching and CI/CD processes.

---

### **Coding Challenges**
- Merge sorted arrays.
- Find unique values in an array.
- Convert strings to uppercase.
- Remove whitespace from a string.
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Linear).

---

### **Common Testimonies**
- **Java Focus:** OOP, Lambdas, Streams, Exceptions, Collections.
- **Spring Focus:** Annotations, Beans, REST API, MVC, error handling.
- **SQL Focus:** Joins, ACID, table creation.
- **React Questions:** Virtual DOM, hooks, routing, components.
- **Frontend/Backend Emphasis Varies:**
  - Some interviews heavily backend-focused.
  - Others emphasize React or CSS/JS specifics.
- **Unexpected Topics:** Be prepared for topics outside the curriculum, e.g., Cartesian products, SOLID principles.
- **Soft Skills:** Limited questions; focus on technical expertise and projects.
